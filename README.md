# Spaceship
A nice arcade game to spend your time.
Includes a working points system and a store! Doesn't require internet connectivity and is very small and not battery-consuming!

Written exclusively in Java and includes a functioning Database, this game is a school project that I've invested way too much in. You can be inspired from my code which I made sure to documentate and organize so it'll be easier to read. If you have any questions, bugs or contributions, go on and post them!

- Various enemy types
- Different weapons
- Store with reasonable prices
- No ads or in-game purchases!
